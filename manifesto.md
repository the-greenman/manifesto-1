The Greenman´s Fixer Manifesto
=============================

**1. If it’s broken, fix it!** Because everyday practical problem solving is the most beautiful form of creativity there is.

**2. If it’s not broken, improve it.** A small, clever tweak can improve how something works for years to come.

**3. Give your products a longer life.** If we double the life of our stuff, we halve what goes to landfill.

**4. Fixing means freedom and independence.** As a fixer, you don’t need to worry about wear and tear. Nothing stays new, so forget perfection.

**5. Resist trends and needless upgrades.** They fuel our throwaway culture.

**6. Don’t let companies treat you as a passive consumer.** Every time we spend money, we vote for the kinds of products we want to see succeed. Buy products that can be repaired.

**7. A fixed thing is a beautiful thing.** Every fix, whether skillful or improvised, holds a story.

**8. If you have an idea, start small and make it good.** If it’s right, it’ll grow from there.

**9. Nurture your curiosity. Keep trying things you’ve never tried before.** It’s good for your brain and your soul. Don’t be afraid to fail — it makes success all the sweeter.

**10. People are infinitely diverse. Products should be too.** Everything can be improved or customised.

**11. Disposability is a choice, not a physical characteristic.** Plastics aren’t evil, but we’re using them wrong. Treat them with respect.

**12. Share your ideas, your enthusiasm and your skills.** If you’ve found the joy of fixing, pass it on. It’s a gift for life.
